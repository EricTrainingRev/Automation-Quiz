# Instructions
The goal of this activity is to create End to End automation tests using the features files and web pages provided. The base maven project has already been created: the pom is set up, the web pages are complete, and the feature files are also complete. It is your job to implement the acceptance criteria and get all the steps to pass. It is up to your discretion whether you want to use page object models or not.

### Order of Operations
1. clone the main repository
2. create a branch off of main. Call it after your first and last name
    - example: firstLast
3. Create your End to End tests
4. Publish your branch when instructed

### Scoring
You will be graded based on how many acceptance criteria steps are passing (partial credit may be given for incomplete tests if some but not all steps are implemented). A minimum step completion of 80% is required for a passing grade. Your trainer will run your code to determine what the completion rate is.

### Restrictions
- You may not change the html files
- You may not change the acceptance criteria
